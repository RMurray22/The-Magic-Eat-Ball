## Description

The Magic Eat Ball is an application designed to remove the frustration of being unable to decide where to eat, or to help the adventurous person find new places to eat.  The application allows the user to press a button and randomly select a restaurant within 10 miles of their location.  The user is also able to create an account and save their favorite restaurants.  Those saved restaurants may also be used to create a random restaurant selection allowing the user to pick from a selection of restaurants they already know they enjoy.

This project gave us the opportunity to use many technologies, including React, GraphQL, Express, Node, and MongoDB to create a full stack application.  The application improved our understanding of how all the technologies work together, and how the data is manipulated through the code to achieve the desired result.

One challenge continues to be getting the correct API call, and being able to pull the data needed, and put it into the form needed for the application.  With every project it has been a little easier, but is not yet a smooth process.

The challenge of orchestrating the creation of the project simulated a real production environment, showing us the need to be able to execute our assigned pieces of code, and make them work well together.  We also experienced the value of communication and being willing to help the other team members through coding challenges.  We also learned that together, we were able to accomplish the build much more quickly than if we would have worked individually.
